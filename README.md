# Sentinel-Rules
Just a dump of all the rules I've either written or found online that I find useful for alerts/threat hunting

I will try explain why the rule was created, and any common FP's I've seen that might help out

Any rules picked up on my way will be referenced back to the creator :)

Will also have a big note sheet in here of little tricks or explanations for certain functions in KQL
